# SpringDepEasy
SpringDepEasy is a Visual Studio Code extension that simplifies adding, removing, and managing Spring Boot dependencies in Maven-based projects without needing to visit external sites like mvnrepository.com. It provides an intuitive UI within VS Code to search, select, and configure dependencies directly in the pom.xml file.
